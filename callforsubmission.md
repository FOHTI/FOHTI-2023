## FOHTI-2023 Theme: FAIR Ontology Harmonization

The use of ontologies in scientific research has become increasingly important in recent years. Ontologies are valuable tools that enable researchers to semantically annotate their data, making it more easily discoverable, shareable, interoperable, and reusable. However, the lack of harmonization and standardization among ontologies can lead to several issues, including inconsistencies in data, redundancies, and gaps in knowledge representation. The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) can be applied to ontologies development to address those challenges. In 2022, during the inaugural meeting of FAIR Ontology Harmonization and TRUST data Integration ([FOHTI-2022](https://FOHIT.github.io/FOHTI-2022/)), the community recognized the importance of applying those principles.It is essential for an ontology to be both FAIR [[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)] and TRUSTable [[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0486-7)] according to its definition. However, there are still challenges in effectively implementing the FAIR principles in ontology development, harmonization, trustworthiness, and user focused applications.

To address those challenges, we are pleased to announce the *FOHTI-2023:FAIR Ontology Harmonization and Workshop*, which will provide a forum for discussing the challenges and solutions related to FAIR ontology harmonization. The workshop will take place as a half-day hybrid event of interactive sessions, providing opportunities for participants to engage in discussions and networking.We welcome submissions from researchers, practitioners, and industry experts who are interested in sharing their experiences, tools, and strategies for harmonizing ontologies in a FAIR manner.

### Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- How to make ontologies more FAIR
- How to apply FAIR principles in ontology harmonization
- FAIR ontology mapping and alignment
- FAIR ontology merging and modularization
- FAIR ontology quality control and evaluation
- Use cases and success stories of FAIR ontology harmonization

## Publication
Accepted papers and presentations will be made available on the workshop website.

## Open Science and FAIR Principle
Open Science and the FAIR principles are essential for advancing scientific research and promoting knowledge sharing. Our workshop embraces the practice of Open Science and FAIR principles. All material including submission, slides, and videos will be made publicly available after the workshop. All submissions should obtain DOIs for the submission and related material via a generalist repository (such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [OSF](https://osf.io/), and [other general repositories](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/generalist_repositories.html)).

## Submission Instructions: 
- Extended abstracts can be 1-2 pages; 
- short-length manuscripts for workshops are generally 5-6 pages.
- Manuscripts must be submitted as PDFs via [Google Form](https://forms.gle/2rSkez3iNrKYNois5).
- Manuscripts should be formatted using the following [ICBO 2023 template](https://icbo-conference.github.io/icbo2023/call-for-submissions/#submission-format-workshops-tutorials-papers-and-abstracts).
